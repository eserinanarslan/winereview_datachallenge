The task is to predict the points of the wines according to the reviews.

There are 5000 records (rows) in the training and validating datasets, and each consists of 3000 features, which are extracted from reviews. The label file contains the performance (points) for each record.

Please build your model to predict the performance of the test datasets.

Feel free to use any programming languages and environments, however, IPython Notebook is highly recommended.

Please send your code as well as the results. You don't need to tune the model to a superb performance in such a short time, we want to see your mastery of the steps of building a model (such as data preprocessing, model selecting and tuning, and result analysis, etc.).

Have fun!
